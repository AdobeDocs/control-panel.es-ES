It is essential to monitor your subdomains to ensure that are all configured properly to work with Adobe Campaign.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe does not recommend using subdomains with no certificate date as it could mean that these subdomains may be having some deliverability issues.

When launching a verification, several operations are performed to check that the subdomain is correctly configured (instance tenant check, email sending test, etc.)

If the subdomain&#39;s verification fails, contact Adobe Customer Care for further investigation.
